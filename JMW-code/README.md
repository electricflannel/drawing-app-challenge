# Social Tables Front End Apprentice Challenge
Thanks for your interest in the Social Tables Apprentice Program! 

[Social Tables](https://www.socialtables.com/) engineering is looking for apprentices! The position is a great opportunity to learn and grow on a fantastic team working with fun, exciting tech.

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to build out some features for a React/Redux drawing app. Women, LGBTQ+ and people of color are encouraged to apply!

- **Submissions are due by August 11th.**

If you successfully complete the coding challenge there will be a phone screen and potential on-site interview.  Our goal is for apprentices to begin onboarding three weeks after the deadline. We have some flexibility on start date to accommodate your schedule.

## The App
The app is a React/Redux app which lets you draw on a `<canvas>` element with different brush sizes.

## The Challenge

We need to make our drawing app more fun and functional!
Given a tool & brush size selector, build as many of these additional components as you can:
- [ ] **Colorpicker:** a component that lets you pick a color to draw. The built in HTML color input will be fine here.
- [ ] **Image stamp:** a place for you to upload an image and pop it in the drawing area like so. The image stamp component should give you a preview of the image uploaded. It should function like this: ![Image Stamp Tool](/public/img/stamp.gif?raw=true "Image Stamp Tool")
- [ ] **Eraser:** a tool to erase what you've drawn. Hint: there is a particular color that makes for a great eraser.
- [ ] **Reset:** a button that wipes the entire canvas clean so you can make a new drawing.
- [ ] **Save:** a button that will take what you've drawn in the canvas and open it as an image in another tab so you can save it.

You'll also need to style the sidebar so it looks as close to this image as possible. **Clean, maintainable, and organized (S)CSS is an important part of your submission!**
![Design](/public/img/design.png?raw=true "Design")

It only needs to work in the latest versions of Chrome & Firefox.

## FAQ

**Can I copy code from the Internet?**  
You must cite any outside resources you use in your work (for example, using comments to denote a snippet obtained from Stack Overflow).  

**Can I post my solution to the Internet/GitHub?**  
We ask that you don't. It makes it much harder to evaluate submissions when a completed solution is available for review.

**Can I copy someone else's submission, cite it, and submit?**  
No.

**Can I submit without completing all parts of the challenge?**  
Absolutely! Do as much as you can, seriously. Use your `README.md` to document where you ended up. 

**What is the status of my application?**  
Email [apprenticechallenge@socialtables.com](mailto:apprenticechallenge@socialtables.com).

**I see a typo.**

**I still have a question.**
